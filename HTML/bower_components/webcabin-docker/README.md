# Welcome!

Welcome to WebCabin.org! Your developers cabin, on the web!

Here at Web Cabin, we sincerely believe that anyone with the proper tools can become a developer! The open source community provides us with a powerful network for sharing, inspiring, and revolutionizing the world! It is awfully daunting, viewing the long road ahead through our small cabin window, but all memorable journeys must have a beginning. Will you join us?

### Change Log

#### Version: (pre-release) 3.0.0

-   **WARNING: Before upgrading to this version from 2.2.0, You will need to make the following changes in your implementation:**
-   Themes are no longer linked directly to the page using the &lt;link&gt; tag, instead use wcDocker.theme().
-   If your themes are not found in the "Themes" folder, you will need to assign the correct path when you construct your wcDocker instance.

    ```
    new wcDocker(domNode, {themePath: 'New/theme/folder'});
    ```

-   All `wcDocker.DOCK`, `wcDocker.EVENT`, and `wcDocker.ORIENTATION` enumerations have changed slightly, instead of each being one variable, they are broken into objects.

    ```
    // OLD format...
    wcDocker.DOCK_LEFT;
    wcDocker.EVENT_BUTTON;
    wcDocker.ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL;

    // NEW format...
    wcDocker.DOCK.LEFT;
    wcDocker.EVENT.BUTTON;
    wcDocker.ORIENTATION.HORIZONTAL;

    // Notice how each used to be one variable name...
    // Now they each are an object with the same enumeration inside them,
    // just replace the first '_' with a '.' and they should work fine again!
    ```

-   `wcLayout's` have changed in the following ways:

    -   The original layout class has been renamed to [wcLayoutTable](http://docker.api.webcabin.org/wcLayoutTable.html), and another type of layout now exists as [wcLayoutSimple](http://docker.api.webcabin.org/wcLayoutSimple.html).
    -   `wcLayoutTable.addItem()` and `wcLayoutTable.item()` no longer return a jQuery object. Instead, they return a [layout table item](http://docker.api.webcabin.org/module-wcLayoutTable.html#~tableItem) that can be used to make alterations to that cell.
    -   To use the simple layout on your panel, include the layout option when registering your panel:

        ```
        myDocker.registerPanelType('Simple Panel', {
          // Use the simple layout for the entire panel.
          layout: wcDocker.LAYOUT.SIMPLE,
          onCreate: function(myPanel) {

            // Create a splitter widget with simple layouts.
            var splitter = new wcSplitter($someContainer, myPanel, wcDocker.ORIENTATION.HORIZONTAL);
            splitter.initLayouts(wcDocker.LAYOUT.SIMPLE, wcDocker.LAYOUT.SIMPLE);

            // Create a tab frame widget with a tab that uses a simple layout.
            var tabFrame = new wcTabFrame($someContainer, myPanel);
            tabFrame.addTab('Custom Tab 1', 0, wcDocker.LAYOUT.SIMPLE).addItem($someItem);
          }
        });
        ```

-   The following functions are now `deprecated` and will be removed in an upcoming version:

    -   `wcDocker.basicMenu()`, renamed to `wcDocker.menu()`.

-   **`Collapsible panels:`** Panels can now be collapsed to the side or bottom of the screen, where they become a slide-out drawer above the main layout.
-   **`Panel creation elements:`** Instead of relying on the context-menu controls to add new panels, you can now add the CSS class **`"wcCreatePanel"`** to any dom element along with the data attribute **`"panel"`** and wcDocker will treat it as a panel creation control. A user will then be able to drag-drop that element into their view to create new panels of the specified type.

    ```
    {@lang xml}<span class="wcCreatePanel" data-panel="My Custom Panel Type">Create My Custom Panel Type</span>
    ```

-   **`Tab orientation:`** Tab controls displayed on panels and the custom tab widget can now be oriented to the left, right, or bottom edges (browser must support css transforms).

    ```
    myDocker.addPanel('Some Panel', wcDocker.DOCK.STACKED, parentPanel, {tabOrientation: wcDocker.TAB.BOTTOM});

    var myCustomTabFrame = new wcTabFrame(domElem, myPanel);
    myCustomTabFrame.tabOrientation(wcDocker.TAB.LEFT);
    ```

-   Built in loading screens for both panels (`wcPanel.startLoading()` and `wcPanel.finishLoading()`), and the entire window (`wcDocker.startLoading()` and `wcDocker.finishLoading()`), and also included a new `wcDocker.EVENT.LOADED` event that is triggered once all panels have been initialized and have finished their loading screens if they've started one.
-   Great improvements to splitter bar movement, moving one splitter no longer causes others to move (unless it explicitly pushes them).
-   Improvements to the wcLayout object, css changes to the table cells and rows are now persistent even if the grid size changes.
-   Tab widgets now only show on panel frames that contain more than one panel.
-   Panels can now be registered as `persistent`.
    -   When the user closes a persistent panel, it is hidden instead of destroyed.
    -   When the user adds that panel back into their view, if there are any previously hidden panels of that type, it will be shown instead of creating a new panel instance.
        ```
        myDocker.registerPanelType('persistent panel', {
          isPersistent: true,
          onCreate: function(myPanel) {
            myPanel.on(wcDocker.EVENT.PERSISTENT_CLOSED, function() {
              // The user has closed this panel, but instead of being destroyed, it is only hidden.
            });
            myPanel.on(wcDocker.EVENT.PERSISTENT_OPENED, function() {
              // The user added this panel type, but actually only re-shown this persistent version of the panel instead.
            });
          }
        });
        ```
-   The collapse direction button on a panel can now be overridden if the built in calculation does not meet your needs. See [wcPanel#collapseDirection](http://docker.api.webcabin.org/wcPanel.html#collapseDirection) for more information.

    ```
    // You can override the direction with your own calculation function callback
    myPanel.collapseDirection(function(bounds) {
      return wcDocker.DOCK.LEFT;
    });

    // Or you can set it to a static direction
    myPanel.collapseDirection(wcDocker.DOCK.RIGHT);

    // Or you can restore it back to the default calculation
    myPanel.collapseDirection(false);
    ```

-   Source code now supports [DCL](http://www.dcljs.org/)!
-   Front page Theme Builder is now built into the libraries.
    -   To include it in your project, you will need to include [spectrum](https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/) into your project as well as register a panel to be used for the theme builder:
        ```
        myDocker.registerPanelType('Theme Builder', {
          faicon: 'map',
          onCreate: wcThemeBuilder
        });
        ```
-   `wcDocker` is now published to npm.

#### Version: 2.2.0

-   Separated the default theme out of `wcDocker.css` (now use `wcDocker.css` with `Themes/default.css`).
-   Added `wcDocker.panelTypeInfo()` and `wcPanel.info()` that will retrieve the registration data of a panel.

-   New event type `wcDocker.EVENT.INIT`.
-   Panel width and height can now be retrieved.

-   Reduced DOM changes during tab change and resize.
-   New event types `wcDocker.EVENT.BEGIN_DOCK` and `wcDocker.EVENT.END_DOCK` that trigger whenever the user is dragging a panel to a new location.
-   New event types `wcDocker.EVENT.GAIN_FOCUS` and `wcDocker.EVENT.LOST_FOCUS` that trigger whenever a panel is brought it and out of focus.
